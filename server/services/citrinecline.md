The lesions usually appear over the face but can involve the upper chest, back, and upper arms where the sebaceous glands are active. The condition is very common in teenagers; however, it may affect middle-aged adults, as is the rising trend in metropolitans. In some cases, inflammation and infection triggered by bacteria show more severe acne. Treatment depends on the extent and severity of acne. But it is of utmost importance to consult a dermatologist for acne instead of trying home remedies and self-medication.\n\n**Types of Acne**\n\n- Whiteheads\n- Blackheads\n- Papules or skin lesions\n- Pustules\n- Nodules\n- Cystic lesions\n\n[Read More](/acne)\n\n## OUR TECHNOLOGIES\n\n![Exilis Elite](assets/images/img/tech01.webp)\n\nExilis Elite\n\n![G3 CO2 Laser](assets/images/img/tech02.webp)\n\nG3 CO2 Laser\n\n![Secret MNRF](assets/images/img/tech03.webp)\n\nSecret MNRF\n\n![HIFU](assets/images/img/tech04.webp)\n\nHIFU\n\n![Primelase Laser](assets/images/img/tech05.webp)\n\nPrimelase Laser\n\n![Hydrafacial MD](assets/images/img/tech06.webp)\n\nHydrafacial MD\n\n![Oxygeneo](assets/images/img/tech07.webp)\n\nOxygeneo\n\n![Alma Clearlift](assets/images/img/tech08.webp)\n\nAlma Clearlift\n\n![MIRA Peel](assets/images/img/tech09.webp)\n\nMIRA Peel\n\n‹›\n\n[View All](/technologies)\n\nLatest Blogs\n\n![What Is Body Contouring?

Acne scars are formed when the inflammatory lesions of acne are overhealed with the formation of fibrous adhesions at the site of acne lesions.  \n  \nThey are broadly of four types, ice pick, rolling, box scar, and hypertrophic scars. Rolling scars are easier to treat than the others.  \n  \n[Read More](https://www.citrineclinic.com/acne-scar-treatment)\n\n**Acne Scar Treatment**\n\n- [Tca Cross](https://www.citrineclinic.com/acne-scar-treatment#tca-cross)\n- [Microneedling](https://www.citrineclinic.com/acne-scar-treatment#microneedling)\n- [CO2 Laser](https://www.citrineclinic.com/acne-scar-treatment#co2-laser)\n- [Blood-derived Growth Factors](https://www.citrineclinic.com/acne-scar-treatment#blood-derived-growth-factors)\n- [Subcision](https://www.citrineclinic.com/acne-scar-treatment#subcision)\n\nOpen pores\n\nOpen pores also referred to as enlarged or dilated pores, are characterized by the visible presence of larger and more prominent pores, particularly on the face.

Scars\n\n# Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon\n\nAcne Scar Treatment Cost in Gurgaon ranges from Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 45,000.\n\nAcne scars are the raised or depressed lesions of scar tissues that appear due to the unusual healing of inflammatory acne blemishes. For some people, they are undesirable reminders of a bothersome and painful condition. When acne leaves behind scars on the face or other visible body parts, they make people distressed or self-conscious of their looks, which is why they may look out for aesthetic dermatologist procedures to get rid of acne scars. Consult Dr. Niti Gaur at Citrine Clinic for ***acne scar treatment in Gurgaon***.\n\nThankfully, there are many acne scar treatments including natural home remedies, over-the-counter treatments, and prescribed dermatological medical treatments in Gurgaon offered at Citrine Clinic that could help dramatically improve the appearance of acne scars and promote healthy skin. But, before jumping onto the best medical treatment options for acne scars, it is important to go through how acne scars develop and their types or severity.\n\n## How Does Acne Cause Scars?\n\nInflammatory acne is formed by clogging the skin pores with excess sebum, dirt, dead skin cells, and acne-causing bacteria. This acne reaches deep into the skin and results in damage to the underlying skin tissues by swelling and breaking down the wall of the pores. Consequently, the body responds to the damage by boosting collagen fibers production. Unfortunately, the natural wound healing response does not go smoothly and results in flawless skin that appears the same as the normal, healthy skin, thereby causing acne scars.\n\nSome acne scars are shallow and heal quickly because they are the result of inflammation of small acne blemishes. However, some acne scars are deeper, formed because of the spilling of the contents of acne blemished into the surrounding, healthy skin tissues. If one is experiencing acne scars, they can consult the skin expert Dr. Niti Gaur, ***acne treatment doctor in Gurgaon*** at Citrine Clinicto get an effective treatment for acne and acne scar.\n\nNot everyone, some people having acne breakouts are likely to develop scars when their acne clears. The risk is more in people who:\n\n- **Have inflammatory acne type-** Often the cysts and nodules that tend to be deep-seated in the skin could cause greater skin damage and result in scarring.\n- **Delays or not properly treating inflammatory acne-** the risk of scarring is greater in those who have got inflammatory acne for long periods.\n- **Squeezes, picks, or pops acne**- These actions could increase swelling. The pus-filled acne may spill out its contents to the healthy surrounding skin and leave behind marks or scars.\n- **Have a genetic predisposition to acne scars**- Heredity or family history of people developing acne scars could be a culprit.\n\n## Types of acne scars:\n\n![Types of acne scars](https://api.citrineclinic.com/backend/service/image/acnescars-infographic.webp)\n\n**Mainly, acne scars are classified into three types:**\n\n**1.** **Atrophic (depressed) scars:** These look like small indentations or depressions in the skin. They are formed when the skin does not make sufficient fibroblasts (cells that are crucial in wound healing and the production of collagen and elastin fibers) in the natural healing process. Further, they are divided into three sub-types:\n\n- **Ice pick scars-** These look like pitted or sunken indentations, like pinpricks. Their appearance is the same as that of an ice pick tool that has a wide shaft on its top which narrows down to the tip as it goes deep into the skin. They are common but very challenging scars to heal. Mostly, they are seen on the areas with thin skin like the upper cheeks and forehead.\n\n- **Boxcar scars-** These are large, oval, or round-shaped skin indentations with clear, sharper edges that go deep into the skin. They commonly develop on the jaw and lower cheeks.\n\n- **Rolling scars-** These are skin indentations with unclear edges that gives the skin an undulating, rolling appearance. They are mainly found in areas with thick skin like lower cheeks and jaw.\n\n**2. Hypertrophic (raised) scars:** These skin lesions of scar tissues are formed when the skin starts producing abundant collagen fibers as the acne spot heals, causing them to rise off the skin. Usually, they are found on the back, chest, jawline, and shoulders.\n\n**3.** **Keloid scars:** These are a kind of hypertrophic scar that tends to be thicker than the original acne spot and even darker (hyperpigmented) than the surrounding skin. They may appear brown or red and may be painful, tender, or itchy.\n\nMake a visit now at Citrine Clinic to get effective***acne scar treatment in Gurgaon*** and achieve smooth, healthy, and glowing skin. The following treatments are offered at Citrine Clinic.\n\n## Treatment Options offered at Citrine Clinic:\n\nEvery type of acne scar cannot be removed with a particular acne treatment.This means every treatment option offers varying degrees of success depending upon the type and extent of acne scarring.Here are some of the  ***best acne scar treatment in Gurgaon***  options performed by a ***[dermatologist in Gurgaon](https://www.citrineclinic.com/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)*** at Citrine Clinic:\n\n**1. Subcision in Gurgaon**\n\nSubcision, also referred to as subcutaneous incision - less surgery, is a minor surgical procedure to treat atrophic acne scars.The treatment involves the use of a tri - beveled hypodermic needle that is administered into the acne scar through a puncture in the surface of the skin, and its sharp edges to skilfully or carefully move under the defect to make subcuticular cuts.It is done to break apart the fibrotic strands that tether the acne scars to the underlying subcutaneous tissue.The depressed acne scars are lifted by this treatment and from the connective tissue that forms during the normal wound healing response.Get the benefits of *acne scar removal with subcision in Gurgaon*, make a visit at Citrine Clinic.\n\n**2. Chemical peel in Gurgaon**\n\nChemical peeling involves the use of acids/special chemicals to exfoliate the skin- i.e. remove the top affected, old skin layer and allow the healthy, clear, smooth skin from underneath to present, that has fewer scars. There are three types of chemical peels: mild/superficial, medium, and deep peels which vary in the strength of the acid used and the degree of penetration. The most commonly used chemical peels to treat acne scars include glycolic acid, salicylic acid, resorcinol, Jessner’s solution, and trichloroacetic acid.\n\nThe  ***acne scar treatment doctor in Gurgaon***  Dr. Niti Gaur recommends the best type of chemical peel which is suitable for the patient’s skin type, the severity of acne, and acne scar type. Depending upon the type of chemical peel chosen, the treatment may be repeated several times for achieving and maintaining optimal results.\n\n**3. Dermal Filler in Gurgaon**\n\nSoft tissue fillers like hyaluronic acid, autologous fat, or other collagen - stimulating fillers like polymethylmethacrylate, poly - L - Lactic acid, silicon, and polyacrylamide can be administered into the skin to safely and effectively plump a few depressed / atrophic acne scars, but not ice pick scars.Most fillers provide us temporary results lasting for 6 to 18 months while some are semi - permanent and permanent too.Depending upon the type of filler used, the patient may need to repeat taking the treatment after some months.Silicon and polyacrylamide may never need replacement.\n\n**4.

The lesions usually appear over the face but can involve the upper chest, back, and upper arms where the sebaceous glands are active. The condition is very common in teenagers; however, it may affect middle-aged adults, as is the rising trend in metropolitans.\n\nIn some cases, inflammation and infection triggered by bacteria show more severe acne. Treatment depends on the extent and severity of acne. But it is of utmost importance to consult a dermatologist for acne instead of trying home remedies and self-medication. Among many providers of acne treatment in Gurgaon, you should consult the **best acne doctor in Gurgaon** at Citrine Clinic. Our team of experts is dedicated to offering result-oriented customized acne treatments.\n\n## Types of Acne\n\n![Types of Acne](https://api.citrineclinic.com/backend/service/image/acne-infographic.webp)\n\nFollowing are some common types of acne that affect many individuals:\n\n- **Whiteheads** are closed, clogged comedones on the skin. These are small, white-colored bumps or spots. They appear like white, circular spots surrounded by a red halo. Whiteheads do not cause the formation of scars.\n- **Blackheads** are open, clogged comedones on the skin. They appear as small, black-colored spots. The center of blackheads appears darker than the skin around it. Blackheads are formed when whiteheads get in contact with dust, air, and dead cells.\n- **Papules or skin** **lesions** are small, tender, and red bumps present on the surface of the skin. The skin around the papules appears slightly red and swollen. Papule is formed due to bacterial invasion and excess activity of androgen. It does not have pus-filled in it; when it accumulates pus, it becomes a pustule.\n- **Pustules** are papules in which pus is present at their tips. These are tender, larger bumps with a circular center. Whitish and yellowish pus is present inside these centers. Bacterial cells invade such centers and make the condition more severe.\n- **Nodules** are present deep inside the skin and appear as large, solid, and painful lumps. When clogged pores damage cells and tissues deep inside the skin surface, they form nodules. Nodules are a severe form of acne that can lead to forming scars and dark spots.\n- **Cystic lesions** are very large, pus-filled, and painful lumps present deep inside the surface of the skin. Cysts are a more severe form of acne that can lead to deep scars.\n\n## Factors that Cause Acne\n\n- Excess oil production\n- Hair follicles connected to dead skin cells and oil glands\n- Bacterial colonisation\n- Excess activity of the androgen hormone\n- Genetics\n\nBeing amongst the top providers of **acne treatment in Gurgaon** our specialists know what importance the right diagnosis plays in offering an effective treatment.

It is inﬂuenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.  \n  \nThe ageing process of the face involves a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic ageing is inﬂuenced by genetic factors and hormonal changes that occur naturally. On the other hand, extrinsic ageing is primarily driven by external factors such as sun exposure, pollution, smoking, and lifestyle choices.  \n  \n[Read More](https://www.citrineclinic.com/ageing-skin)\n\n1.

Anti-Wrinkle Injections\n\n# Anti-Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon\n\nAnti-Wrinkle Injection Cost in Gurgaon ranges from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 30,000\n\n### What do Anti-wrinkle Injections Comprise of?\n\n**Anti wrinkle injection in Gurgaon** involves micro injections of Bot-uli-num toxin, a purified form of a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clo-stri-di-um bot-uli-num.  It is used medically and cosmetically to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines temporarily.\n\n### How do These Injections Work?\n\nWhen injected into specific muscles, Bot-uli-num toxin works by blocking the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. This prevents the muscle from contracting, thus reducing the dynamic wrinkles caused by repetitive muscle movements. Thus it can smooth out wrinkles, particularly those formed by facial expressions such as frowning or squinting.\n\n## What Areas can it be Used For?\n\nAnti-wrinkle injections is commonly used for areas such as\n\n- forehead lines,\n- frown lines between the eyebrows,\n- crow's feet around the eyes\n- necklines\n- Chin dimpling\n- Inverted smile\n\nHowever, its usage and effectiveness may vary depending on individual factors, so it's best to consult with a qualified medical professional, such as a dermatologist, to determine if **anti wrinkle injection in Gurgaon** are suitable for your specific concerns.\n\n**Is Anti-wrinkle Injections Safe?**\n\nBot-uli-num toxin (Bo-to-x) is an anti-wrinkle injection which is considered safe when administered by a qualified medical professional, such as a dermatologist. However, it's important to discuss your medical history and any potential contraindications with your dermatologist before undergoing treatment.\n\n## How Long does the Effect Last?\n\nIt's important to note that anti-wrinkle injections do not directly heal or eliminate wrinkles permanently. Instead, it provides a temporary improvement in their appearance. The effects typically last for several months, and then the muscle activity gradually returns, which may necessitate additional treatments to maintain the desired results.

[Home](/)\n2. Blood-derived Growth Factors\n\n# Blood-derived Growth Factors\n\nThe blood-derived growth factor is a procedure that is used for skin rejuvenation and anti-ageing purposes. It involves extracting a small amount of your blood, processing it to get concentrated blood containing growth factors, and then injecting the resulting solution into specific areas of the skin.  \n  \nThis extracted solution contains growth factors and other bioactive substances that promote the following:\n\n- tissue repair.\n- stimulate collagen production\n- improve skin texture and tone\n\nWhen injected with blood-derived growth factors, these growth factors can stimulate cellular regeneration and collagen synthesis. This leads to improved skin quality and a more youthful appearance.  \n  \nThe frequency of anti-ageing and skin rejuvenation blood-derived growth factors treatments can vary depending on individual needs and goals. Typically, a series of treatments is recommended, with intervals of several weeks to a few months between each session. Your dermatologist or medical professional will assess your skin condition and provide personalized guidance on the optimal frequency of blood-derived growth factor treatments based on your specific situation.  \n  \nIt's worth noting that the eﬀectiveness of blood-derived growth factors for anti-ageing and skin rejuvenation may vary among individuals.

[Home](/)\n2. Body contouring\n\n# Body Contouring Treatment in Gurgaon\n\nBody contouring encompasses a range of medical procedures and treatments to enhance the body's shape and appearance. These interventions target issues like excess fat, loose skin, or other concerns to achieve a more sculpted and toned physique. Specific body contouring procedures can address specific body areas, such as the abdomen, thighs, arms, or buttocks, where stubborn fat deposits or sagging skin may occur.\n\nThe primary objectives of body contouring are reducing or eliminating excess fat, firming the skin, and improving the body's natural curves and proportions. Both surgical and non-surgical options are available to cater to individual preferences and needs.\n\nFrequent body contouring procedures include liposuction, tummy tuck (abdominoplasty), CoolSculpting (cryolipolysis), laser liposuction, radiofrequency treatments, and injectables that stimulate collagen production. Each procedure is customized to address specific concerns and achieve desired outcomes.\n\n## Indications for Body Contouring\n\nBody contouring is an advanced skin tightening and body contouring method which is done for several reasons. It include:\n\n1. **Persistent Fat Pockets**: Body contouring procedures are suitable for individuals struggling with localized areas of fat that are unresponsive to diet and exercise. These areas commonly include the abdomen, hips, thighs, arms, or chin.\n2. **Loose or Sagging Skin**: Body contouring can help address skin laxity caused by significant weight loss or natural aging. The procedures focus on tightening and firming the skin, particularly in areas prone to sagging.\n3. **Enhancement of Body Shape**: Some individuals seek body contouring to achieve a more sculpted and proportionate physique. This may involve enhancing curves, defining muscle contours, or creating a more balanced body appearance.\n4. **Post-pregnancy Changes**: Pregnancy can lead to changes in the body, such as stretched abdominal muscles or excess skin. Body contouring procedures can help restore pre-pregnancy body contours by addressing these concerns.\n\n## Body Contouring Treatments\n\nBody contouring treatments encompass a range of options, with the choice depending on individual goals, preferences, and specific areas of concern. Common body contouring procedures include:\n\n**1. High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)**:  It is a non-invasive technique used for body contouring that utilizes targeted ultrasound energy to heat specific layers of the skin. HIFU helps achieve a more sculpted and contoured appearance by stimulating collagen production and promoting tissue tightening.\n\n- During a HIFU session, ultrasound energy is applied to specific body areas, such as the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, or arms. This energy safely passes through the skin without causing harm and focuses on deeper layers where fat deposits reside. Controlled heating of these targeted tissues triggers a natural healing response, leading to collagen production and skin tightening over time.\n- One of the notable advantages of HIFU is its non-invasive nature, eliminating the need for surgical incisions or downtime. The treatment is generally well-tolerated, allowing patients to resume their normal activities immediately following the procedure.\n- It is important to emphasize that HIFU is best suited for individuals who are already close to their desired weight but have specific areas of concern. To assess eligibility for HIFU and develop an appropriate treatment plan tailored to individual needs and goals, it is crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare professional who specializes in body contouring treatments.\n\n**2. Exilis Elite**: It is a competent non-invasive body shaping treatment that utilizes radiofrequency (RF) energy to target stubborn fat deposits and tighten the skin, resulting in improved body contours and overall appearance.\n\n- During an Exilis Elite session, RF energy is precisely delivered to specific body areas, such as the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms, or neck. The treatment utilizes a combination of controlled heating and cooling to target fat cells and stimulate collagen production, leading to fat reduction and skin tightening.\n- The RF energy safely penetrates the skin's surface, reaching the deeper layers where fat deposits are located. By gradually heating the fat cells, Exilis Elite prompts their breakdown and elimination through the body's natural processes. Simultaneously, the RF energy stimulates collagen remodeling, promoting skin tightening and firmness.\n- Exilis Elite is suitable for individuals seeking to address localized areas of fat and achieve skin tightening. It can eﬀectively target concerns such as love handles, muffin tops, cellulite, and loose skin in various body areas.\n- An important advantage of Exilis Elite is its non-invasive nature, allowing one to resume daily chores and work without delay.\n\n**3. Cool Sculpt**: Cool sculpting is a non-surgical body contouring treatment that uses controlled and focused cooling technology to target and dissolve persistent fat cells in specific areas of the body. Also known as cryolipolysis, this procedure aims to enhance body contours and overall shape.\n\n- During a CoolSculpting session, a specialized device is applied to the targeted areas, such as the abdomen, ﬂanks (love handles), thighs, or arms. The device delivers precise cooling to the fat cells, causing them to freeze without causing harm to surrounding tissues. Through a process called apoptosis, the frozen fat cells gradually break down and are naturally eliminated by the body over time.\n- CoolSculpting primarily focuses on localized areas of fat that are resistant to diet and exercise. It can eﬀectively diminish the appearance of bulges and unwanted fat deposits in specific regions, resulting in a more sculpted and contoured physique.\n- A notable advantage of CoolSculpting is its non-invasive nature, as it does not require surgical incisions or anesthesia. The procedure is generally well-tolerated, allowing patients to resume their normal activities immediately after the treatment. However, individual experiences and outcomes may vary.\n\n**4. EmSculpt**: EmSculpt is an advanced body contouring treatment that uses high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology to induce powerful muscle contractions in targeted areas. This procedure promotes muscle building and toning, resulting in a more sculpted and defined appearance.\n\n- During an EmSculpt session, a specialized device is applied to the desired treatment areas, such as the abdomen, buttocks, arms, or thighs. The device emits electromagnetic energy, which stimulates muscle contractions beyond what can be achieved through voluntary exercise alone.\n- These intensified muscle contractions engage a significant number of muscle fibers, leading to muscle strengthening and growth. This process, referred to as supramaximal contractions, facilitates increased muscle mass, improved muscle definition, and enhanced overall body contours.\n- EmSculpt is primarily intended for individuals already in relatively good physical shape but seeking further muscle toning and sculpting. It can be particularly beneficial for those aiming to enhance abdominal muscle definition, lift and shape the buttocks, or tone the arms and thighs.\n- An important advantage of EmSculpt is its non-invasive nature, eliminating the need for surgery, incisions, or anesthesia. The procedure is generally well-tolerated, allowing patients to resume their regular activities immediately afterward.\n\n### HIFU - High-Intensity Focussed Ultrasound.\n\nIt is a non-invasive means of body sculpting and tightening.\n\nHave you ever wondered how suddenly your skin has started looking aged? When did those fine lines and lax skin become part of your identity? Why does it not seem taut and shiny like before ??\n\nWell, this is how aging looks! A wrinkle here, a fold of skin there!\n\nBut why are we bothered about it now? How were the earlier generations dealing with this?\n\nWell, the answer is one that you would not like. We have started aging earlier, almost by a decade!! OOPS\n\nThe increasing stress, the want to excel, those extra hours spent in front of the desk, that one more hour of sleep compromised, all this has cumulatively aged us earlier.\n\nWell, don’t worry. Science is progressing at a rate faster than your age !!\n\n**Mechanism of action**\n\nHIFU is a procedure that brings about a non-surgical facelift. The ultrasound waves thus heat up the cells and cause controlled cell damage that stimulates collagen production in the long run. Collagen is the primary protein that maintains skin tightness and elasticity; hence, its increased production helps to deal with fine lines, wrinkles, and lax skin.\n\nThe energy emitted acts directly on the deeper layers of the skin, such that the outermost visible layer of skin remains unaffected.\n\n**Procedure**\n\n- The treatment area is prepared under aseptic measures.\n- A topical numbing cream is applied to the concerned area.\n- Energy is set according to the degree of severity and the site involved.\n- The probe is used in regular motions for the required amount of time at a particular area to generate adequate heat energy for collagen stimulation.\n\nThere is minimal downtime in the form of mild post-procedure redness that subsides on its own in a few hours.\n\nA single cycle consists of two sessions, 2 weeks apart. The results are maintained for 6 months.\n\n**Start early. Start safe. Start non-surgical.**\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha]()\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

Dark Circles\n\n# Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon\n\nDark Circles Treatment Cost in Gurgaon  ranges from Rs. 3000 and Rs. 35000\n\nNothing makes a person appear exhausted than dark circles beneath the eyes. The skin around the eyes is delicate and easily affected by sleep deprivation and hyperpigmentation. In general, skin discolouration can cause under-eye bags and dark circles, making a person appear older. The Citrine clinic offers highly efficient treatment for various types of dark circles. The procedure usually begins with a thorough examination of the underlying cause of the dark circle, followed by a holistic and tailored strategy for treating and removing them. Not only does the treatment make you seem more awake and younger, but it is also highly safe and complication-free.\n\nCitrine is the top pick for many men and women seeking ***dark circles treatment in Gurgaon***.\n\n![Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](https://api.citrineclinic.com/backend/service/section/1755348579264.jpg)\n\n## What are the most common causes of dark circles?\n\nThe skin on the body and face is thicker than the face. The skin under the eyes is a very delicate region. It is impacted by a lack of sleep, fatigue, and inflammation.\n\nUnder-eye dark circles can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n- Sleep deprivation and a lack of sleep impacts general health, particularly on the face significantly. One of the critical causes of dark circles beneath the eyes is a lack of sleep.\n- Constant screen exposure can cause eye strain and the formation of new dark circles.\n- Aging causes the skin to sag and wrinkles to appear, and dark circles to seem worse than before.\n- Dehydration\n- Sun exposure can induce hyperpigmentation and dark circles due to the formation of melanin.\n\n## How can dark circles be treated?\n\nThe treatment of dark circles starts with determining the actual cause of the dark circle. If a lack of sleep causes dark circles, they will usually go away on their own after making lifestyle changes. Clinical intervention is frequently necessary for situations of persistent and stubborn dark circles.\n\n## What treatments are available at the Citrine clinic?\n\nWe don't believe in quick fixes at the Citrine clinic.

[Home](/)\n2. Ear Piercing\n\n# Ear Piercing in Gurgaon\n\n**Ear Piercing Cost in Gurgaon ranges from Rs. 300 - Rs. 1,000.**\n\nTradition, science, and fashion - ear piercings are favored by all. While getting your ears pierced is a pretty simple process, it may look scary at first. And if not carried out under proper care, piercings can lead to several complications, too. This is why, before getting your or your kid's ears pierced, you should have a good knowledge of the process. Below is a detailed account of everything you need to know about **ear piercing in Gurgaon** by [Dr. Niti Gaur](https://www.citrineclinic.com/dermatologist-in-gurgaon).\n\n## What is an Ear Piercing? Who Should Get It?\n\nIn medical terms, ear piercing is the process of pricking a hole in the earlobe or other parts of the ear using a needle or a needle gun. Some people get these piercings for traditional reasons and others just for fashion. You can get a piercing in the earlobe or other regions of the ear. However, piercing the earlobe is known to be the least painful as it has fewer nerve cells.\n\nIt is a medically backed-up fact that anyone can get a piercing, regardless of age and gender. However, people who have an overactive immune response or suffer from a condition that slows down or prevents the healing process are advised not to get a piercing. Some of these conditions include:\n\n- Pregnancy\n- Diabetes\n- Haemophilia\n- Heart disorders\n- Autoimmune diseases like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.\n- Skin disorders like keloids (formation of large scars around the region of traumatic injury)\n- Redness, patches, rashes, or infection in the area.\n\nWhile little kids can get piercings too, it is advised to wait until they are old enough to take proper precautions. Scratching the pierced area, touching it with dirty hands, or pulling on the ear stud can increase the chances of infection.\n\n## Who Should Do the Ear Piercing? How to Be Prepared?\n\nEar piercing is done by both medical and non-medical professionals. You can visit either for a piercing. Before getting it done, make sure of the following things:\n\n- The piercing should be done in a clean cabin, away from human gatherings and dust and dirt to prevent infection.\n- The needle or the gun used for the piercing should be sterilized properly.\n\nInform the doctor if you have any metal allergies. Mostly, people are allergic to nickel. It is safe to use a needle and starter earrings made of 14-karat gold, titanium, or surgical level steel.\n\n## How is Ear Piercing Done?\n\nBefore a piercing, the doctor might give you a local anesthetic. Or rubbing an ice cube over the area also numbs it for a few minutes. There are 2 major ways to perform an ear piercing:\n\n**(i) Using an ear-piercing kit**\n\nThis kit consists of needle guns with embedded ear studs. The gun pricks a hole at the desired spot and the ear stud is lodged simultaneously into the hole. It is a quick and efficient process.\n\nHowever, needle guns are non-disposable gadgets. If not sterilized properly, they carry a high risk of contamination.\n\n**(ii) Using a needle**\n\nIt involves the use of a hollow bore needle and a smaller needle. The piercing is done using the needle and the hollow needle is slipped over it. Then, taking out the smaller needle, the post of the ear stud is inserted through the hollow needle. The hollow needle is then removed and the ear stud is secured to the pierced hole by a backing.\n\nThe healing time of the piercing varies depending on the area. An earlobe piercing takes up to 6-8 weeks whereas a cartilage piercing can take 4 months to one year to heal completely. During this period, if you have any infection, swelling, redness, or too much itching in the area, visit your dermatologist immediately.\n\n## Take Proper Precautions After the Piercing\n\nOur [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](https://www.citrineclinic.com/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)offers quality services for ear piercings in Gurgaon. After the piercing, the doctor might prescribe you some antibiotics or immunosuppressants. Avoid touching the piercing and clean it regularly with sterile saline water. Also, avoid eating too many sweets and going into pools or hot water tubs. Taking proper precautions would help you avoid any infection or other complications and you would be good to go!\n\n## Ear Piercing Cost in Gurgaon\n\n**Ear Piercing Cost in Gurgaon ranges from Rs. 300 - Rs. 1,000.**\n\nThe ear piercing cost in Gurgaon and other regions may vary between 300-1000 INR. We strictly advise against getting a piercing at home as it will increase the risks of getting an infection.

[Home](/)\n2. Excessive Hair Growth\n\n# Excessive Hair Growth\n\nAre you also seeking a permanent solution to your twice-monthly hair removal shebang?\n\nIs waxing, epilation, chemical hair removal, and razor usage leading to skin rashes, pimples, and allergies also for you?\n\nWORRY NOT! - In today’s era of advancing technologies, the US-FDA has approved a set of lasers for Laser hair reduction (LHR). This can also be used by people with conditions such as hirsutism, the presence of hair in a male pattern, and those having increased hair growth because of hormonal imbalance, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n\n## Advantage of Lasers for Hair Removal\n\n1. It is the only treatment that alters the length, color, and thickness of treated hair, making it thinner and lighter and decreasing the growth rate of hair over a period of time.\n2. It does not lead to any post-treatment, rashes, or acne.\n3. It is associated with minimal post-treatment erythema, which is temporary in nature and subsides on its own.\n4. The procedure is almost painless compared to conventional, highly painful hair removal methods.\n\n**Indications (Areas treated by Lasers)**\n\n- Sites with terminal hair:\n  - Face, predominantly chin, upper lip, and side locks.\n  - under-arms\n  - back\n  - chest and mid-riff\n  - arms\n  - legs\n  - bikini area\n- Hirsutism\n- Post-PCOS increased hair growth\n\n## Procedure of Laser Hair Removal\n\nLaser hair removal involves following steps:\n\n1. The area to be treated is first shaved using a sterile disposable razor after gel application.\n2. Areas not to be treated are first crossed out, and the areas to be treated are confined into boxes of specific sizes to deliver energy in a pre-specified manner.\n3. Depending on the patient's pain threshold, stamping or in-motion mode is selected.\n4. Energy is increased at every session to inactivate the hair follicle over a period of time sequentially.\n5. Post-procedure, the treatment area is wiped clean, followed by applying moisturizer and an anti-inflammatory lotion.\n\n**Device Used**\n\nState-of-the-art, US-FDA, approved triple wavelength technology-based device, i.e., a laser that provides three wavelengths.\n\n- Alexandrite laser -755 nm\n- Diode laser - 810 nm\n- NdYag laser - 1064 nm\n\nThus every hair follicle is catered from root to tip, ensuring the best outcome! MECHANISM OF ACTION\n\n- 755 nm: specially designed for lighter skin types and lighter hair.\n- 810 nm: Safe for all skin types\n- 1064 nm: best suited for darker and tanned skin. It has deeper penetration and minimally affects the surface epidermal melanin, thus allowing for safer and more effective treatment.\n\nTreatment success can be assessed by follicular edema and red bumps indicative of effective thermal damage of hair follicles.\n\n### How many sessions are required?\n\nThe average Indian requires 8-10 sessions with sequentially increased doses of energy. However, the exact number of sessions varies from person to person and site to site in the same person. These can’t be pre-determined, but we at Citrine aim to provide the end result in 6 sessions spaced at 4-6 weeks, followed by 6 maintenance sessions taken by the patient when deemed appropriate as per their hair growth.\n\nIs Laser Hair Reduction Safe?\n\nYes, it's absolutely safe. Long-term studies have seen no other post-procedural effects besides temporary redness and mild itching post-session. The very commonly associated myth of the risk of cancer associated with laser hair reduction stands invalidated even after 30 years of research. Owing to its targeted chromosphere-based action, lasers are now highly selective and safe!\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha]()\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

[Home](/)\n2. Exilis Elite\n\n# Exilis Elite\n\n**What is Exilis Elite?**\n\nExilis Elite is a medical device that uses RADIO-FREQUENCY(RF) and ULTRASOUND technology to deliver energy to the skin's deeper layers in a non-invasive manner.\n\n**What Areas is it Used For?**\n\nThe treatment is popularly used to address BODY CONTOURING and SKIN TIGHTENING, including the reduction of wrinkles and fine lines in areas such as:\n\n- Face\n- Jawline for Double chin\n- Neck\n- Arms for flabby skin\n- The abdomen for tummy fat\n- Flanks for love handles\n- Thighs for cellulite and fat\n- Back for bra rolls\n\nWhen used for the **abdomen**, Exilis can help to reduce stubborn fat pockets, tighten the skin, and improve the appearance of stretch marks.\n\nWhen used for **post-pregnancy stretch marks**, it can help improve the skin's texture and tone, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and enhance the skin's youthful appearance.\n\n## How Does Exilis Work?\n\nIt is not to be used as a substitute for proper diet and exercise.\n\n**How many Sessions are Required?**\n\nThe number of sessions depends on the area being treated. On average, 10 to 12 sessions are required for every area that is undergoing contouring. The maximum gap between two sessions can be upto two weeks. For best results, take sessions at one-week intervals.\n\n**Is Exilis Safe?**\n\nExilis is a safe procedure with a very advanced combination of two complex technologies. It is painless and does not require the use of any numbing. When done by a trained therapist under a dermatologist’s guidance, the procedure is most efficient.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha]()\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

[Home](/)\n2. Eye Restore\n\n# Eye Restore\n\nIt is a multi-step program involving laser toning, chemical peeling, and infusion of serums for dark circles and under-eye rejuvenation.\n\n**What does it Do?**\n\nThis treatment program consists of the following components:\n\n- Aqua therapy exfoliates the upper dead cell layer and hydrates the skin.\n- **Dark circle peel**: contains depigmenting agents which reduce the dark circles\n- **Laser treatment**: this breaks the pigment cells and stimulates cell rejuvenation.\n- **Infusion of serums**: these have antiageing eﬀects by stimulating collagen production.\n\n**Who can get it done?**\n\nPatients with dark circles, wrinkling, hollowing and puffiness in the tear trough area.\n\n## How is it Done?\n\n1. The face is cleaned with Aqua therapy to remove the upper dead cell layer and hydrate the skin.\n2. A dark circle peel is applied with a brush over the periorbital area and kept for 10 minutes.\n3. This is followed by laser treatment, which breaks the pigment cells.\n4. A cocktail serum containing hydrating agents, antioxidants and anti-ageing peptides is infused by electroporation technique.\n5. An eye mask is applied for 10 minutes and then removed.\n\n**How does it Work?**\n\n**Dark circle peel**: this contains lactic acid ( improves the fine lines and wrinkles), arginine (increases collagen and elastin production) and glycerine (hydrates the skin)\n\n**Laser treatment**: the laser beam gets absorbed by the pigment-containing cells, resulting in their destruction, followed by stimulation of collagen, which improves the skin texture.\n\n- Infusion of Serums contains antioxidants like vitamin C, hydrating agents like hyaluronic acid, and antiageing peptides, which give the skin a refreshed look.\n\n## What are its advantages?\n\n- It is a safe, non-invasive procedure\n- There is minimal downtime\n- It reduces dark circles and fine wrinkling under the eyes\n- The rejuvenating agents give a hydrated and refreshed appearance.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n**Q1.  How often should this procedure be done?**\n\nAns. 6 sessions at a gap of 2 weeks are recommended.\n\n**Q2. When will the results be visible?**\n\nAns. Results are usually visible after 4–6 weeks.\n\n**Q3. What precautions are to be taken after the procedure?**\n\nAns. AFTERCARE includes\n\n- Strict sun protection\n- Use of moisturizers\n- Anti-inﬂammatory agents for 3 days after the procedure.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha](data:image/jpeg;base64,)\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

Pla-te-let-rich fibrin therapy involves injecting these growth factors under the eyes.

This, in turn, gives the skin a glowing, youthful appearance. With age, the amount of Hyaluronic acid in our skin starts reducing, which can cause the face to appear thin, dull and lustreless. Fillers are preparations of hyaluronic acid, which are injected into the skin to fill the areas of volume loss and restore the natural glow of the skin.  \n  \n[Read More](https://www.citrineclinic.com/under-eye-fillers)\n\n![Under Eye Fillers](https://api.citrineclinic.com/backend/service/image/secondcategory_image_1694434411.webp)\n\n![Under Eye Puffiness](https://api.citrineclinic.com/backend/service/image/secondcategory_image_1694434454.webp)\n\nUnder Eye Puffiness\n\nPuﬀy eyes occur when there is swelling around the eyes, causing them to look puﬀed up.

[Home](/)\n2. FUT Hair Transplant\n\n# FUT Hair Transplant in Gurgaon\n\nFollicular Unit Transplantation or FUT hair transplant in Gurgaon is a strip procedure in which a group of 1–4 hairs, called a unit, is implanted to the affected area of balding or thinning. These 1–4 groups of hairs are small and naturally occurring. The microscopic dissection is used to extract a thin piece of the scalp and tissues. It creates a wound that is later closed once the follicles are harvested enough for implantation. This procedure leaves a fine and linear scar. The main goal and advantage of using the FUT technique is achieving natural results with manageable recovery time. A comparatively higher rate is observed for the survival of follicles as the tissue remains intact during the harvesting procedure, which releases higher quality and robust grafts. Additionally, there is no scarring in the follow-up and subsequent sessions of implantation.\n\n## Who is the ideal candidate for FUT Hair Transplant in Gurgaon?\n\nThe ideal candidate for *FUT hair transplant in Gurgaon* could be men with permanent observed androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). FUT is only applicable for people above 25 years of age as hair loss patterns are difficult to predict at a younger age. Hair thickness plays an important role to determine the type of technique to use; high density of hair follicles tend to perceive fullness with better coverage. FUT is a preferred technique to treat baldness in the front area of the head, also known as the crown area.\n\n## How does a hair transplant work?\n\nFUT hair transplant is a type of restoration procedure in which a strip (1–1.5 centimetres or 0.4–0.6 inches approx.) of scalp skin is cut from the back of the head which is later sealed by stitches. The portion is separated into small sections. This will help in achieving natural-looking hair growth, once hair is implanted. This procedure uses local anaesthesia so that the patient experiences less pain. Once the entire procedure of extracting from the donor area and implantation to the affected area is completed, bandages and antibiotics will be applied to the scalp to avoid the risk of any infection. The results are expected to be observed in 6–9 months. However, it may take 1 year for certain individuals depending on their skin type, the severity of baldness and density of harvested follicles.\n\n## What to expect after a FUT Hair transplant?\n\nFUT generally takes up to 5 weeks to recover with swelling and discomfort that may continue for a few days. It is imperative to follow post-operative care with a proper routine to achieve desired outcomes. Stitches will be removed after 7–10 days of the procedure.\n\n- Do not take shower or wash your hair for at least 5 days.\n- Once hair wash is started, use prescribed and gentle shampoos.\n- Take optimum rest to facilitate healing.\n- Avoid brushing and combing and do not cover your hair by wearing hats or beanies till your doctor confirms.\n- Avoid any strenuous physical activity.\n- Follow a balanced diet and optimum water intake.\n- Follow prescribed medications and routine visits for any adequate treatment, if required.\n\n## Success Rate of FUT Hair Transplant in Gurgaon\n\nFUT has an advantage with a higher survival rate as compared to other techniques such as Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). Data from clinical studies have revealed that about 85–95% of the implanted grafts grow easily in the transplanted area. This data supports the high efficiency and success rate of the hair transplant procedure based on the customer’s satisfaction, which is an important aspect of the calculation. If the surgeon makes a detail-oriented path, different techniques might even increase the success rate to 95–95%.\n\n## Complications and potential side effects\n\nThe observed complications with FUT are rare. However, individuals may experience some common side effects, such as:\n\n- Scarring or bumps formation, which will fade over time. But it will remain permanent on the skin which may stay hidden with your hairs in general cases.\n- An unnatural look of the hair for initial months.\n- Swelling, scabbing and pain will subside over time, and with regularising prescribed medications.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha](data:image/jpeg;base64,)\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

It can manifest gradually over time or occur suddenly, leading to partial or complete baldness. Both men and women can experience hair loss, which can stem from various factors like genetic predisposition, hormonal fluctuations, medical conditions, medications, stress, inadequate nutrition, or specific therapies such as chemotherapy.\n\nThe extent and pattern of hair loss vary widely among individuals and can have significant emotional and psychological implications. Treatment options are contingent upon the underlying cause and may encompass medication, topical remedies, lifestyle modifications, or hair restoration procedures. Seeking professional guidance from a dermatologist or healthcare provider is advisable for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.\n\n1. Home\n2.

Hair Restoration surgery helps such patients to regain their lost confidence.\n\n## Types of Hair Transplants offered at Citrine Clinic\n\nHair restoration procedures are of 2 different types:\n\n**Follicular unit strip surgery (FUSS):**During this procedure, a surgeon uses a piece of skin with exposed hair follicles from the back of the scalp. The hair follicles are then removed from the skin using a microscope**.**After that, they are transplanted to the recipient's desired region of the head.\n\n**Follicular unit extraction (FUE):**In the procedure of **[FUE Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](https://www.citrineclinic.com/fue-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)**, the surgeon uses a tiny punch tool to extract hair follicles from the back of the scalp without removing a strip of the skin. The hair follicles are then put into the recipient's desired area. This procedure requires less scarring, and the person does not need stitches.\n\n## How Does a Hair Transplant Work?\n\nA hair transplant is a treatment that involves transplanting your natural hair into an area where you don't have hair. It can be taken from the back of your head, or other parts of your body as well.\n\nYour surgeon sterilizes the region from where the hairs are taken. They numb the region with a local anesthetic before beginning the transplant. If you wish to sleep during the procedure, a surgeon can prescribe medication.\n\n**Subsequently, your surgeon will opt to undertake one of two available transplant procedures: FUT or FUE.**\n\n**FUT:-**In follicle Unit Strip Surgery the surgeon removes a section of your scalp with a knife. A strip of around 6 to 10 inches long, commonly running from ear to ear, is chosen.\n\nThe surgeon next split the hairline piece into grafts, which can be as small as 2,000 little pieces. Mostly, one hair is present in some of these grafts. After that, The surgeon next uses a syringe or blade to create tiny holes in your scalp where hairs will be grafted. Stitching is done wherever the scalp is removed and covers the surgical area with bandages or gauze.\n\n**FUE:-** In this procedure, the hairs from the back of your head are taken off. Individual follicles are then extracted from the scalp skin by the surgeon. Each follicle will have a little mark where it was extracted. The surgeon makes tiny holes in your scalp and transplants hair follicles into the holes. After that, they cover the surgical area with bandages or gauze.\n\n## Procedures of Hair Transplant in Gurgaon\n\nCitrine Clinic, the **best hair transplant clinic in Gurgaon**, provides world-class facilities and gold-standard hair transplant services**.**  It is one of Gurgaon's best hair transplant clinics.

[Home](/)\n2. HIFU\n\n# HIFU - High-Intensity Focussed Ultrasound\n\nIt is a non-invasive means of facial sculpting and tightening.\n\nHave you ever wondered how suddenly your skin has started looking aged? When did those fine lines and lax skin become part of your identity? Why does it not seem taut and shiny like before? Well, this is how ageing looks! A wrinkle here, a fold of skin there!\n\nBut why are we bothered about it now? How were the earlier generations dealing with this?\n\nWell, the answer is one that you would not like. We have started ageing earlier, almost by a decade !! OOPS\n\nThe increasing stress, the want to excel, those extra hours spent in front of the desk, that one more hour of sleep compromised has accumulated us earlier.\n\nWell, don’t worry. Science is progressing at a rate faster than your age !!\n\n**Indications**\n\n- Fine lines\n- Wrinkles\n- Eyebrow lift\n- Cheek contouring\n- Double chin removal\n- Jawline enhancement\n- Improves skin elasticity\n\n## HIFU’s Mechanism of Action\n\nHIFU is a procedure that brings about a non-surgical facelift. The ultrasound waves thus emit heat to the cells and cause controlled cell damage that stimulates collagen production in the long run. Collagen is the primary protein that maintains skin tightness and elasticity. Hence, its increased production helps to deal with fine lines, wrinkles and lax skin.\n\nThe energy emitted acts directly on the deeper layers of the skin, such that the outermost visible layer of skin remains unaffected.\n\n**Procedure**\n\n- The treatment area is prepared under aseptic measures.\n- A topical numbing cream is applied to the concerned area.\n- Energy is set according to the degree of severity and the site involved.\n- The probe is used in regular motions for the required amount of time at a particular area to generate adequate heat energy for collagen stimulation.\n\nThere is minimal downtime in the form of mild post-procedure redness that subsides on its own in a few hours.\n\nA single cycle consists of two sessions, 2 weeks apart. The results are maintained for 6 months.\n\n**When to Start?**\n\nAs the saying goes, prevention is better than cure, so why hide or camouflage a wrinkle when you can prevent one?\n\nStart early. Start safe. Start non-surgical.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha]()\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

[Home](/)\n2. Hydrafacial MD\n\n# Hydrafacial MD\n\n**What is Hydrafacial?**\n\nHydrafacial MD is a popular medifacial that involves a strategized multi-step process of cleansing, exfoliating, extracting impurities, and hydrating the skin. It uses a specialized machine that delivers a unique combination of VORTEX technology, gentle suction, and serum infusion to improve the skin's overall appearance, texture and health. Hydrafacial is known for its ability to address a wide range of skin concerns, including fine lines, roughness, acne, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone.\n\n**Who Should Get Hydrafacial Done?**\n\nHydrafacial is specially designed for dull, dehydrated and uneven-toned skin. It suits all skin types seeking fresh, radiant, smooth textured skin. It is a hydra-dermabrasion procedure.\n\n## What Does Hydrafacial Do?\n\nHere are some of the advantages of Hydrafacial:\n\n1. **Deep Cleansing**: Hydrafacial uses a specialized device to cleanse and exfoliate the skin, removing impurities, dead skin cells, and excess oil. It provides a thorough deep cleanse, leaving the skin refreshed and rejuvenated.\n2. **Hydration**: The treatment includes a hydrating step that infuses the skin with moisturizing serums, helping to replenish and hydrate the skin. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals with dry or dehydrated skin.\n3. **Reducing Fine Lines and Wrinkles**: Hydrafacial can help improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The exfoliation and infusion of potent serums promote cell turnover and stimulate collagen production, resulting in smoother and more youthful-looking skin.\n4. **Even Skin Tone**: The treatment can help address uneven skin tone and pigmentation issues, such as sunspots or age spots. It targets hyperpigmentation and encourages a more even complexion.\n5. **Reduced Pore Size**: Hydrafacial effectively unclogs and minimizes the appearance of enlarged pores. The suction-based extraction process removes impurities from the pores, resulting in a more refined and smoother skin texture.\n\nThe technology works by heating the deep layers of the skin, stimulating collagen production, and causing the skin to contract, which results in a tighter, smoother appearance.\n\nIt is also a non-invasive, quick, and relatively painless procedure with little to no downtime.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that Exilis Elite is not for everyone and should only be administered by a qualified and experienced practitioner. Exilis is not a weight loss treatment and should not be considered one.\n\n## Steps of Service\n\n**1. Lymphatic Drainage**\n\nTo flush out the toxins and increase blood circulation.\n\n**2. Cleanse + Peel**\n\n-HydraFacial uncovers a new layer of skin with gentle exfoliation and relaxing resurfacing\n\n-The Activ-4™ serum removes dead skin cells to reveal healthy skin, and the GlySal™, a mixture of glycolic and salicylic acids, delivers the benefits of a peel without post-peel scaling.\n\n**3. Extract + Hydrate**\n\n-The patented, automated vortex suction painlessly cleans out pores with the exclusive Beta-HD™ serum\n\n-Antiox+™ serum nourishes and protects with antioxidants, peptides, and hyaluronic acid\n\n**4. Fuse + Protect.**\n\nIt saturates the skin’s surface with antioxidants and peptides to maximize your glow.\n\n**5. Red and Blue Light Therapy**\n\nRed light for anti ageing purposes and collagen stimulation. Blue light for acne-prone skin owing to its antibacterial properties.\n\n**Regularity of Hydrafacial**\n\nHydrafacial can be taken once a week initially. Twice a month on a regular basis after that.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha]()\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

Is waxing, epilation, chemical hair removal, and razor usage leading to skin rashes, pimples, and allergies for you as well?\n\nWORRY NOT ! - In today’s era of advancing technologies, US-FDA has approved a set of lasers for Laser hair reduction (LHR). This can also be used by people with conditions such as hirsutism, the presence of hair in the male pattern, and those having increased hair growth because of hormonal imbalance, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n\n**Advantage**\n\n- Sites with terminal hair\n- Face, predominantly chin, upper lip, and side locks.\n- under-arms\n- back\n- chest and mid-riff\n- arms\n- legs\n- bikini area\n- Hirsutism\n- Post-PCOS increased hair growth\n- Painless and long-lasting results\n\n## Procedure\n\n1. The area to be treated is first shaved using a sterile disposable razor after gel application.\n2. Areas not to be treated are first crossed out, and the areas to be treated are confined into boxes of specific sizes to deliver energy in a pre-specified manner.\n3. Depending on the patient's pain threshold, stamping or in-motion mode is selected.\n4. Energy is increased at every session to inactivate the hair follicle over a period of time sequentially.\n5. Post-procedure, the treatment area is wiped clean, followed by the application of moisturiser and an anti-inflammatory lotion.\n\n**Device Used**\n\nState-of-the-art, US-FDA, approved triple wavelength technology-based device, i.e. laser that provides three wavelengths.\n\n- **Alexandrite laser** -755nm\n- **Diode laser** - 810nm\n- **NdYag laser** - 1064nm\n\nThus every hair follicle is catered from root to tip, ensuring the best outcome! MECHANISM OF ACTION\n\n- **755 nm**: specially designed for lighter skin types and lighter hair.\n- **810 nm**: Safe for all skin types\n- **1064 nm**: best suited for darker and tanned skin. It has deeper penetration and minimally affects the surface epidermal melanin, thus allowing for safer and more effective treatment.\n\nTreatment success can be assessed by follicular edema and red bumps that are indicative of effective thermal damage of hair follicles.\n\n### Number of Sessions Required?\n\nThe average Indian female requires 8-10 sessions with sequentially increased doses of energy. The number of sessions varies from person to person and site to site in the same person. These can’t be pre-determined, but we at Citrine aim to provide the end result in 6 sessions spaced at 4-6 weeks, followed by 6 maintenance sessions taken by the patient when deemed appropriate as per their hair growth.\n\n**Is Laser Hair Reduction Safe?**\n\nYes, it's absolutely safe.\n\nLong-term studies have seen no other post-procedural effects besides temporary redness and mild itching post-session.

[Home](/)\n2. Laser Hair Removal\n\n# Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon\n\nLaser Hair Removal cost in Gurgaon ranges from Rs. 20,000 - Rs. 70,000.\n\nDr Niti Gaur at Citrine Clinic caters to every person for **laser hair removal in Gurgaon** by reducing the fertility and capacity of the hair follicles to regrow. In subsequent sessions, the hair growth is drastically reduced with a soft and smooth skin appearance.\n\nManagement of body hair is a distressing task. One can easily get sick of traditional methods of removing it temporarily and rather opt for a permanent way out. All people desire hair-free and smooth skin. People often opt for quicker methods of hair removal like shaving and waxing, but these are just temporary solutions. These methods are usually painful, and messy and leave one with ingrown hair which can be painful. Therefore, laser hair reduction, in comparison, is a more effective method to deal with unwanted body hair for both men and women. For the best laser hair reduction treatment in Gurgaon, one must ensure that they only consult a certified dermatologist. It is a gentle technique that treats larger areas efficiently with minimal discomfort and absolutely no downtime.\n\n## How is Laser Hair Removal Procedure Performed?\n\n![How is Laser Hair Removal Procedure Performed?](https://api.citrineclinic.com/backend/service/image/performed.webp)\n\nRegardless of the area or site that needs to de-fuzz, laser hair reduction treatment can be of great help. The procedure allows the hair follicles to be completely destroyed in just a matter of minutes with minimal discomfort. Laser light energy emitted by the source is absorbed by the pigment of hair which convert it into thermal energy, which then ultimately leads to hair follicle damage. Repeated such treatment leads to permanent reduction in hair follicular density, hair thickness and colour.\n\nBefore initiating laser hair reduction, the to-be-treated area will be trimmed. A cooling gel will be applied to the target area facilitating laser light to penetrate deeper into the skin. After careful examination, laser beams will be adjusted according to the skin color, hair color, the thickness of the hair, and location of the hair that is to be removed. Then, low-level light beams are shot at the targeted area, burning the hair and hampering further growth. When the procedure is completed, cold compressors, cold water or anti-inflammatory creams or lotions will be applied to soothe the treated areas and reduce any discomfort.\n\n## Best Technology for Laser Hair Removal\n\n**Citrine Clinic**uses various laser technologies to be able to provide optimum results to each one of our patients.\n\n- **Diode:** Diode lasers use a longer wavelength (810nm), which penetrates deeper. One can get great results with a diode for coarse hair and dark skin tones.\n- **Alexandrite:** This uses a shorter wavelength (755 nm) but is faster. Hence, preferred for treating larger areas. It is ideal for lighter skin tones.\n- **Nd:YAG:** This technology (1064nm) is effective for almost all types of hair including dark tones and tanned skin. Dermatologists around the world prefer this technology for fine hair and large body parts as it’s quick\n\n**Device Used**\n\nState-of-the-art, US-FDA, approved triple wavelength technology-based device, i.e. laser that provides three wavelengths.\n\n- Alexandrite laser -755nm\n- Diode laser - 810nm\n- NdYag laser - 1064nm\n\nThus every hair follicle is catered from root to tip, ensuring the best outcome! MECHANISM OF ACTION\n\n- 755 nm: Specially designed for lighter skin types and lighter hair.\n- 810 nm: Safe for all skin types.\n- 1064 nm: Best suited for darker and tanned skin.\n\nTreatment success can be assessed by follicular edema and red bumps that are indicative of effective thermal damage of hair follicles.\n\n## How Does Laser Hair Removal Treatment Work?\n\n![How Does Laser Hair Removal Treatment Work?](https://api.citrineclinic.com/backend/service/image/treatmentwork.webp)\n\nLaser hair reduction procedure uses a high-intensity laser light that penetrates hair follicles. The pigment in the hair absorbs the laser light, which destroys the hair follicle inhibiting further growth.\n\nLaser hair removal has become increasingly popular since it first became commercially accessible in the late 90s. It aids in achieving a permanent solution for unwanted hair. The complete hair removal procedure is completed in 6-8 sessions, although different hair types and densities may require a different number of sessions.

We, at Citrine Clinic, offer unparalleled, budget-friendly **laser tattoo removal treatment in Gurgaon**.

It is the **best tattoo removal treatment in Gurgaon** for those who want to get rid of their dark tattoos. This service is offered by a licensed dermatologist, Dr. Niti Gaur at Citrine Clinic.\n\n## How Does Laser Tattoo Removal Work?\n\nThe **laser technology for tattoo removal** works to raise the skin temperature and precisely dissolve the tattoo ink pigments. A laser device emits high-intensity light pulses which, when focused onto the tattooed skin, instantaneously generate a lot of thermal energy. This energy gets absorbed by the tattoo ink pigments causing them to break down into finer particles and further get eliminated from the body with the help of the immune system cells.\n\n## Benefits of Laser Tattoo Removal\n\nThe advantages of choosing professional, laser tattoo removal include:\n\n- Natural-looking results\n- Time-saving treatment sessions\n- Effective, gradual removal of all tattoo inks\n- Minimal risk of serious side effects like scarring\n- A precise tattoo removal; no harm to the surrounding healthy skin\n- A safe tattoo removal option for any skin type/color/thickness.\n\n## Who Can Get Laser Tattoo Removal?\n\nThe candidates who meet the laser **tattoo removal eligibility** requirements and are the **best candidates for tattoo removal** include:\n\n- Non-smokers\n- People with realistic expectations\n- Individuals with no allergy to tattoo ink\n- Non-pregnant or bre-astfeeding women\n- Those who have faded/outdated tattoos\n- Those who have unwanted/regretted tattoos\n- Those who have professional and amateur tattoos\n- Healthy adults with good functioning immune system\n- Those who have multicolored tattoos that they are conscious about\n- People with a strong contrast between skin color and tattoo ink color.\n\n## How Many Sessions Are Required for Complete Tattoo Removal?\n\nThe number of laser sessions needed for the optimal **tattoo fading process** is 6 to 12 on average, scheduled in 6-8 week gaps. Some factors that affect the **tattoo fading timeline** or number of sittings include:\n\n- The age of the tattoo\n- The laser type used\n- The immune system response\n- The location, size, color, and depth of the tattoo placement.\n\n## Is Laser Tattoo Removal Painful?\n\nLaser tattoo removal can hurt, but the procedure is usually tolerable and not as painful as getting the skin permanently tattooed. Some people report feeling a warm pinprick sensation, while others relate the pain level to a rubber band being flicked against the skin.\n\nAt Citrine Clinic, we ensure **pain-free tattoo removal** procedures. Our experts utilize numbing cream and cooling device to ensure a comfortable treatment experience.\n\n## Pre-Treatment & Aftercare for Laser Tattoo Removal\n\nThe **laser tattoo removal healing process** is gradual and can take several weeks to get over. To ensure proper and quick skin healing, dermatologists advise following both **tattoo removal pre-care and aftercare for tattoo removal.**\n\n### Pre-Treatment Guidelines\n\n- Avoid injuring the skin of the tattooed area\n- Avoid applying any cosmetics to the treatment area\n- Avoid taking photo-sensitizing medications two weeks before the session\n- Avoid overexposing the skin to direct UV light from the sun or artificial sources.\n\n### ​Aftercare Instructions\n\n- Sun-protect the treated area\n- Apply ice packs to soothe inflamed skin\n- Keep the treated skin clean and dry\n- Avoid smoking or alcohol intake\n- Avoid shaving the treated area until the skin entirely heals\n- Apply antibiotics for a few days to keep the skin infection-free\n- Refrain from high-impact activities, direct heat exposure, and swimming for 24 hours or until the skin heals\n- Keep skin well hydrated by drinking plenty of water and even well-nourished by having a healthy diet.\n\n## Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment Cost in Gurgaon\n\nThe laser **tattoo removal cost in Gurgaon** ranges from Rs. 2000 to Rs. 15,000 per session.

However, permanent erasing or 100% removal of a tattoo is somewhat not possible if the pigment is too deep for lasers to reach.\n\n### Do tattoo removal creams work?\n\nNo. Tattoo removal creams are not FDA-cleared products. Their application on the skin can lead to unwanted reactions, even permanent damage to the skin or tissue.\n\n### What is the fastest type of tattoo removal?\n\nLaser tattoo removal is the fastest, safest, and most effective approach to getting rid of permanent tattoos.\n\n### Do you bleed after laser tattoo removal?\n\nYes. Pinpoint bleeding is a potential side effect of laser tattoo removal that lasts for about a week. It occurs because the laser’s heat ruptures the tiny blood vessels or capillaries underneath the skin surface. The extent of bleeding depends on the location, size, and depth of the tattoo ink and the individual’s skin type.\n\n### What is the success rate of laser tattoo removal?\n\nThe success rate of laser tattoo removal is variable. The factors on which the laser’s effectiveness or success in tattoo removal depends include tattoo ink color/depth/density/age, the individual’s skin type; and the laser technology used.\n\nVisit now at Citrine Clinic if you are looking for safe **laser tattoo removal treatment in Gurgaon** at the best prices.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha]()\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

Laser Resurfacing\n\nLaser Resurfacing in Gurgaon\n============================\n\nThe scars and marks left behind by acne are even worse than acne breakouts. Also, acne scars are an unwanted reminder of acne and affect self-esteem in some individuals. Most of the acne scars do not go away on their own and need medical attention.\n\nLaser skin resurfacing procedure is one of the most popular cosmetic procedures which helps to rejuvenate the skin. The major aim of this treatment is to achieve an even-looking skin appearance.\n\nAt[Citrine Clinic](https://www.citrineclinic.com/skin-clinic-in-gurgaon), we provide various acne scar treatments including laser resurfacing. To know more about our clinic and our skin resurfacing treatment in Gurgaon, feel free to contact us.\n\nLaser skin resurfacing is a procedure that gives evident results in scar reduction. It is designed to re-epithelialize the skin surface and stimulate collagen production thereby giving even skin tone and texture.\n\n Types of lasers \n\nThere are mainly two types of lasers for managing acne scars\n\n*   Ablative\n*   Non-ablative\n\nAblative laser treatment manages and diminishes acne scars by shedding thin layers of the dead skin. On the other hand, non-ablative is a less invasive procedure which treats acne scars by stimulating collagen production without actually removing the skin.\n\nThe former include carbon dioxide (CO2) or Erbium laser and treat superficial skin concerns as these are designed to remove the upper layer of the skin.\n\nIn contrast, non-ablative lasers don't remove any layer of the skin. At Citrine Clinic, we offer the best laser resurfacing treatment in Gurgaon supported by the most advanced laser techniques. Some of the most commonly used non-ablative lasers are pulsed light and fractional lasers.\n\n Ideal candidates for Laser Skin Resurfacing \n\nOne should consider this procedure in case of aging issues, sun-damage and acne-related skincare concerns, especially acne scars that aren’t improving with over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Laser skin resurfacing works excellently on[acne](https://www.citrineclinic.com/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)and acne scar reduction but can be employed to treat one or more of the following skin concerns-\n\n*   Photo ageing\n*   Fine lines and wrinkles\n*   Sagging skin\n*   Uneven skin tone\n*   Chronic sun damage\n*   Acne scars\n*   Skin rejuvenation\n*   Stretch marks\n*   Post burn & surgical scars\n*   Enlarged oil glands\n*   Warts\n\n How is Laser Skin Resurfacing performed? \n\n**Step 1** - After careful examination, the patient's skin will be prepared for the procedure which also includes cleansing.\n\n**Step 2** - A topical anesthetic will be applied to the targeted area. This will help reduce the pain and allow the patient to be more comfortable during the procedure.\n\n**Step 3** - Then, the selected laser is moved slowly on the skin. It only takes a few minutes\n\n**Step 4** - The process triggers the body's natural healing response by targeting the outer layer of the skin and heating the deeper layer in the dermis.

Freckles\n\nFreckles Treatment in Gurgaon\n=============================\n\nFreckles are flat, circular and tiny blemishes that appear on the skin, most commonly on the face. These spots are darker in appearance than one’s natural skin colour. Freckles usually appear as a result of the clustered concentration of myelinated cells. It is a common skin concern among the group of people who have lighter skin tone. It is also known as Ephelides.\n\n What causes freckles? \n\nAs[Dr. Niti Gaur](https://www.citrineclinic.com/dermatologist-in-gurgaon), one of the Best Skin Doctors in Gurgaon, says - Freckles are believed to originate as an outcome of a combination of genetic inclination (inheritance), and excessive sun exposure. The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) light beams, which when consumed by the skin intensifies the generation of the pigment called melanin. According to various studies, people with light-colored eyes, and lighter skin complexion are particularly more responsive to the damaging influence of UV rays and are more prone to freckles. Freckles are typically nothing but an unusual substantial deposit of melanin at a single spot in the skin making it in tiny dark spots in a clustered form.\n\n Treatments for freckles \n\nFreckle removal treatments would be a welcome idea to anyone experiencing this condition. At Citrine Clinic, several safe and effective methods are available to help lighten and diminish the occurrence of freckles. For the best freckles treatment in Gurgaon, our skin specialist often suggests a combination of topical therapy & procedures depending on the severity of freckles and other such factors. As every individual's skin responds differently, therefore, creating a custom-made treatment plan after examining the case thoroughly helps provide great results.\n\nFreckles can often recur with repeated UV exposures even after treatments. Therefore, sun protection plays an important role in managing the freckles.\n\nFollowing are some of the commonly advised freckles removal treatments at Citrine Clinic in Gurgaon\n\n**1. Bleaching or fading creams**\n\nApplication of various bleaching creams and lotions are considered a good and gentle option when it comes to treating freckles.

These bleaching and fading emulsions are more effective when the patient limits the outdoor visits and uses regular sun protection.\n\n**2. Retinoids**\n\nRetinoids are the most effective remedy for freckles. They are mostly used in conjunction with other bleaching creams and may assist in lightening blemishes when applied as directed by the doctor.\n\n**3. Laser treatment**\n\nLaser treatment with NdYAG laser is a clinically proven treatment to diminish freckles. The treatment usually ends with a high satisfactory results.

[Home](/)\n2. Melasma\n\n# Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon\n\nA common hypermelanotic skin disorder or problem in which dark-brown patches appear on the face is known as melasma. It is also named as the “mask of pregnancy” or “chloasma”. Hormonal imbalance during pregnancy and sun exposure are the main reasons for this condition. Hence, one should prefer consulting a [dermatologist](https://www.citrineclinic.com/dermatologist-in-gurgaon) for Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon instead of self-medication and home remedies because some medications and treatments may not be suitable for a pregnant woman. Melasma is a type of hyperpigmentation problem. In this condition, gray-brown patches appear on the skin, which are darker than the normal skin color. The development of discolored patches on the skin is the primary symptom that appears during melasma. The most affected part of the skin is the bridge of the nose, cheeks, chin, forehead, and area above the upper lip as well. Other affected parts of the skin can be forearms and neck due to higher sun exposure.\n\nThe main reason for melasma is still unclear. It likely appears when the melanocytes (color-determining cells) produce too much color in the skin. People with skin of dark color are more likely to get melasma due to the presence of active melanocytes than people with skin of light color. Women are more likely to get melasma in comparison to men. Sun protection is one common recommendation for melasma. The use of sunscreen and its application every two hours is suggested. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat or scarves to avoid direct exposure to the sun is also recommended by dermatologists to prevent melasma.\n\n## Most common reasons for melasma\n\nIf someone is looking for *Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon*, they must first find out the reason behind it which a dermatologist can help with. Our dermatologists at Citrine Clinic first identify the root cause of melasma and then suggest a treatment so that long lasting results can be achieved. Following are some of the most common reasons for melasma:\n\n**1. Sun exposure:** Melanocytes are stimulated by the ultraviolet (UV) rays that come from the sun. In fact, sun exposure can make melasma return after discoloring. Melasma can worsen in summer due to excessive sun exposure and free radicals damage. It is the main reason for the recurrence of melasma in many people.\n\n**2. Hormonal factors:** Pregnant women are more likely to get melasma. In pregnant women, melasma is named chloasma, or the mask of pregnancy. Contraceptive pills and hormone replacement medicine can also trigger melasma.\n\n**3. Skincare products:** Several skincare products contain specific chemicals that irritate the skin, and their application can worsen melasma.\n\n### Effective treatment options for Melasma\n\nOne can visit Citrine Clinic for all kinds of Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon, including melasma treatment. Following are some of the most preferred treatment options for Melasma:\n\n**Topical medications:** The most prescribed treatment for melasma is certain topical medications. Most of the melasma cases can be treated with these topical medications. Topical medications can be used either alone or in combinations. For more benefits, topical medications can also be combined with other agents such as topical steroids, sunscreen, and glycolic acids. These medications are available in the form of cream, lotion, or gel that can be directly applied to the affected area. It functions by reducing skin discoloration.\n\n**[Laser treatment](https://www.citrineclinic.com/laser-toning-in-gurgaon):** Laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is an effective treatment for various types of pigmentation. In this treatment, the laser emits a specific wavelength that is absorbed by the specific chromophore (dark patches). It enters deeper layers of the skin and reduces the dark patches. This treatment does not damage the skin. The laser provides the skin healthier and younger look. Laser treatment is very effective and comfortable and does not need any numbing cream. The duration of the laser depends on the conditions and type of the affected skin. 2-4 sessions may be required to achieve optimum results.\n\n**Chemical peels:**Most dermatologists recommend chemical peels for the treatment of melasma. Chemical peels are designed for different skin types and conditions. In many clinical trials, peels have shown promising results for melasma. Some of the commonly used chemicals peels are glycolic peels, lactic peels, and the new peeling agent the phytic solution. The peeling agent, the peel concentration, frequency, and duration should be carefully chosen for optimum results.\n\n**Microdermabrasion:** A minimally invasive treatment to renew skin tone and texture is named as microdermabrasion. The occurrence of sun damage, fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, age spots, melasma, and other skin related problems and conditions can be improved by microdermabrasion. In this treatment, dark patches are reduced by gentle removal of the outermost layer of the skin.\n\n**Photofacial treatment:** Photofacial treatment is a kind of skin Resurfacing, which is the best option for melasma treatment. A light-based technology is used in this treatment to improve collagen and to discolor the occurrence of dark patches. In this process, high-level equipment and machines are used, and the two different types of photo facials available are IPL (Intense-Pulsed Light) and LED (Light-Emitting Diode). Intense pulsed light is best for the treatment of sun-induced hyperpigmentation such as melasma. In this treatment, intense laser beams treat the affected areas by destroying the pigmented cells.\n\nTo know more about melasma or any other pigmentation problem and Pigmentation Treatments in Gurgaon, do visit a skin doctor nearby.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha]()\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

[Home](/)\n2. Microneedling\n\n# Microneedling\n\nMicroneedling is an eﬀective treatment option for improving rough skin texture. It involves using a device with fine needles to create controlled micro-injuries on the skin's surface. This process stimulates the skin's natural healing response, resulting in smoother and more refined skin texture. Here's how microneedling can benefit rough skin:\n\n- **Collagen Induction**: The micro-injuries created by the tiny needles stimulate collagen and elastin production, two proteins responsible for skin elasticity and texture. Increased collagen production helps fill fine lines, wrinkles, and areas of roughness, resulting in smoother skin.\n- **Enhanced Product Absorption**: Microneedling creates microchannels in the skin, allowing for better skincare product penetration and absorption. By applying serums or other hydrating and nourishing products immediately after the treatment, you can maximize their eﬀectiveness in improving skin texture and hydration.\n- **Skin Renewal**: Microneedling triggers the skin's natural healing response, leading to increased cell turnover and the formation of new skin cells. This process helps to replace rough and damaged skin with a fresher, healthier skin, resulting in improved texture.\n\nMicroneedling treatments should be performed with a professional device in a clinical setting only for more controlled and precise results.\n\nMultiple sessions of microneedling are usually recommended to achieve optimal results. The exact number of sessions needed may vary depending on the severity of rough skin texture and individual response. Following post-treatment care instructions and protecting the skin from sun exposure during the healing process is important.\n\nConsulting with a dermatologist or a skincare professional is recommended to determine if microneedling is suitable for your specific skin concerns. They can assess your skin, recommend the appropriate needle length and treatment plan, and ensure the procedure is performed safely and eﬀectively.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha](data:image/jpeg;base64,)\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

[Home](/)\n2. Oily Skin\n\n# Oily Skin\n\nEveryone has some oil on their skin. Under each of your pores is a sebaceous gland that produces a natural oil called sebum, keeping your skin hydrated and healthy. But the glands can produce too much oil, which makes oily skin.\n\nYou know you have oily skin if your skin constantly looks shiny and you go through several blotting sheets a day. Oily skin can even feel greasy within hours of cleansing.\n\nBreakouts are also more likely because the sebum mixes with dead skin cells and gets stuck in your pores.\n\nThe causes of oily skin include genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. While you can’t necessarily get rid of oily skin, you can take steps to make your skin less oily. The key is to identify one or more of these seven underlying causes.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n- Chemical peel\n- Medifacial\n- Laser-based procedures Elaboration\n\nChemical Peel\n\n- **Black Peel**\n\n**​** This peel aims at suppressing the oil gland production while at the same time exfoliating any active acne lesions. It also decreases post-inflammatory pigmentation to a certain extent.\n\n6 sessions are indicated at 10-15 day intervals for best results.\n\n- **Acneclear Peel**\n\nIt is a mild-level peel for treating oily skin. This peel also aims at maintaining the results of acne treatment when the lesions have substantially reduced.\n\n6 sessions are indicated at an interval of 10-15 days for best results.\n\nMedifacial\n\n**1. Oil Balance Medifacial**\n\nOil Balance medifacial is an advanced medifacial designed for oily, acne-prone skin, which acts by reducing the overactivity of the oil glands of the skin.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nThis medifacial involves gentle exfoliation of the upper dead layer of the skin, then a natural skin oxygenation followed by a deep facial rejuvenation to boost skin’s health with the infusion of anti-acne agents, with the help of a machine.\n\n**2. Pore Balancing Medifacial**\n\nPore balance is an advanced medifacial specially designed for oily, acne-prone skin. It reduces the oil production from the overactive oil glands and maintains the skin’s moisture content.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nThis medifacial control the oil production from the hyperactive sebaceous glands while maintaining the skin’s moisture balance. It also heals and prevents new acne formation and acne-induced pigmentation and scarring. This gives an instant radiance to the skin.\n\n**3. Triple Treat Therapy**\n\nTriple treat is an advanced medifacial, named due to its triple line of action, namely anti- inﬂammation, enzymatic exfoliation, and hydration.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\n- This medifacial utilises a combination of light therapy, aqua therapy, and infusion of hydrating and anti-ageing serums to achieve radiant, younger-looking skin.\n- The light therapy uses diﬀerent wavelengths of light to kill the acne-causing bacteria and promotes cellular regeneration and healing.\n- Aqua therapy causes deep exfoliation, along with hydration of the skin.\n- The serum removes the dead cells from the upper layer of the skin, leading to skin resurfacing without any harsh eﬀects. This also reduces acne marks and pigmentation. Hence, the skin looks smoother and fresher.\n\nTherefore, a combination of these three gives the skin a refreshed, glowing look!\n\nLaser-based Procedures Carbon Laser\n\n- Works by applying a thin layer of carbon to the skin’s surface. Once the charcoal preparation is evenly distributed, a focused light beam is administered for a precisely targeted area.\n- The carbon particles actively absorb the light before a vacuum suction gently removes them, along with damaged cells found in the upper layers of the skin.\n- Simultaneously generating thermal energy stimulates the synthesis of fresh collagen and promotes a healthy-looking complexion. Skin structure is visibly strengthened, and even opened pores are purified and cleared.\n\nCarbon Peel Facial is an emerging cosmetic procedure that is widely accepted for its non-invasive properties and pronounced outcomes. It is also called Charcoal facial or Hollywood peel.\n\nPhotofacial\n\nIPL means \"Intense pulsed light.\" During an IPL photofacial, a light-producing device is adjusted to target explicit skin concerns or to convey extensive full-face revival. At the point when the pulses of light transmitted by this gadget are consumed by the melanin (pigment) and red blood cells in the skin, heat is created. The IPL gadget is intended to stimulate the skin's regular mending processes without really hurting fragile dermal tissue.\n\nAs your skin endeavors to fix itself, it will shed its dull, harmed external layer and structure flexible, lively new skin. During this cycle, skin-firming proteins (like collagen and elastin) are delivered in overflow. The light produced during IPL treatment likewise separates the dim shade inside age spots and spots, making an all the more even skin tone.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha](data:image/jpeg;base64,)\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

[Home](/)\n2. Paediatric Dermatologist\n\n# Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon\n\nAn infant's skin is quite sensitive and delicate as compared to the adult skin, which makes it more prone to skin infections. Therefore, child skin problems can result in severe skin damage and distress for both parents and the child, if left untreated. Taking medical advice from a **paediatric dermatologist** is recommended to avoid any such unwanted situations. One can consult Dr. Niti Gaur at Citrine Clinic, an experienced child skin specialist in Gurgaon for treating their child skin concerns and problems.\n\nPaediatric dermatology is a blend of paediatric health and dermatology, and it deals with the complicated skin condition of infants. A child can be prone to certain skin diseases or skin irregularities such as atopic dermatitis, diaper rash, bacterial infections, chickenpox, cold sores, rosacea, fungal infections such as ringworm, etc. These skin conditions must be treated as soon as possible by an expert to prevent it from spreading further.\n\nSo, let's discuss these child skin problems one by one and understand what treatment options are available for the same.\n\n**1. Atopic Dermatitis**\n\nAtopic dermatitis is a type of eczema in which there is loss of skin barrier. This skin condition can affect an individual at any age, but it often starts early in childhood. It appears as an itchy rash or rashes. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition that may not diminish until adulthood and hence, requires to be treated by a medical expert. In general, atopic dermatitis affects at the age of 2, making the skin sensitive throughout life.\n\n**2. Fungal Infections**\n\nFungal infection occurs when the skin cells are moist for a longer duration of time. The common areas where an infant can be affected by this skin problem are between the toes and the diaper area. Where some fungal infections can be less irritating, other types can result in swelling, blisters, itching and scaling too.\n\nFungal infections include ringworm infection, which is ring-shaped with scaly patches. An infant who has poor hygiene, is malnourished, lives in warm weather is more prone to get affected by ringworm infection. Common fungal infections include the candidal intertrigo, seborrheic dermatitis, scalp ringworm, nail ringworm, and body ringworm.\n\n**3. Viral Skin Infections**\n\nViral skin infections in infants are called viral exanthema which means rashes or skin eruption caused by a virus. The viral skin infections include:\n\n**a.** Chickenpox is common among children, but can be life-threatening to infants and adults with a weak immune system. The symptoms include skin rash, fever, decreased appetite, joint pain, coughing, rashes, itchy arms and legs.\n\n**b.** Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is caused by the picornavirus family that can affect infants and children in the fall, spring and summer. The symptoms include nasal congestion and malaise, and classic rash over palms, soles, and oral mucosa.\n\n**c.** Warts are skin growths that occur as a result of Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Although this skin condition affects children more than adults, it can develop at any age. Warts are contagious that can spread to other body parts and hence, it is essential to consult a dermatologist to prevent the spreading of this disease.\n\n**d.** Measles (rubeola) is an infectious respiratory illness that results in red, blotchy rashes, and is caused by Rubeola virus. It is a contagious skin problem that can spread as a result of direct contact, nose or throat or airborne droplets. The symptoms apart from rashes include high fever, hacking cough, severe diarrhoea, runny nose, and red eyes. This condition if left untreated it can be life-threatening.\n\n**e.** Molluscum contagiosum: it is a common viral infection caused by pox virus. The skin lesion is a slow growing white papules. Infection can slowly get inoculated to involve surrounding skin.\n\nThese skin infections or skin diseases in infants are very distressing and troublesome for both the child and parents.

[Home](/)\n2. Sagging Skin\n\n# Sagging Skin\n\nSagging skin is a common occurrence with age. As we get older, our skin naturally loses its elasticity and firmness due to several factors, including:\n\n1. **Decreased Collagen and Elastin Production**: Collagen and elastin are proteins that provide structural support and elasticity to the skin. With age, the production of these proteins decreases, leading to a loss of skin elasticity and firmness.\n2. **Reduction in Fat and Muscle Mass**: The underlying fat and muscle tissue that support the skin can diminish over time, leading to a loss of volume and sagging.\n3. **Gravity**: The constant pull of gravity over time can contribute to the downward displacement of facial and body tissues, resulting in sagging skin.\n4. **Sun Exposure**: Prolonged and unprotected exposure to the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays can accelerate the breakdown of collagen and elastin fibers, leading to premature sagging and wrinkles.\n\nWhile sagging skin is a natural part of the ageing process, there are several measures you can take to help improve its appearance:\n\n- **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle**: This includes a well-balanced diet, regular exercise, proper hydration, and sufficient sleep, which can help support overall skin health.\n- **Protect your Skin from the Sun**: Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF, seek shade when the sun is most vital, and wear protective clothing and accessories to minimize sun damage.\n- **Use Skincare Products**: Look for skincare products that contain ingredients like retinol, antioxidants, and peptides, which can help improve skin elasticity and firmness.\n\n## Consider non-surgical treatments:\n\n1. **Dermal Fillers**  \n     \n   Injectable fillers, typically made of hyaluronic acid, can be used to restore volume and lift sagging skin. They are injected into specific areas to provide support and create a more youthful appearance.\n2. **Radiofrequency (RF) Treatments**  \n     \n   RF therapy uses energy waves to heat the deeper layers of the skin, stimulating collagen production and tightening the skin. This can help improve sagging skin and promote a more youthful appearance.\n3. **Ultrasound Therapy**  \n     \n   Similar to RF treatments, ultrasound therapy uses focused ultrasound energy to heat the skin and stimulate collagen production. It can be used to lift and tighten sagging skin on the face and neck.\n4. **Laser Treatments**  \n     \n   Various laser treatments, such as fractional laser resurfacing or laser skin tightening, can help improve sagging skin by stimulating collagen production and promoting skin tightening.\n5. **Chemical Peels**  \n     \n   Chemical peels involve applying a chemical solution to the skin, which causes exfoliation and stimulates collagen production. This can help improve skin texture, tone, and mild sagging.\n6. **Thread Lifts**  \n     \n   Thread lifts involve inserting dissolvable threads under the skin to lift and tighten sagging areas. These threads stimulate collagen production and provide temporary lifting eﬀects.\n\nIt's important to consult with a dermatologist to discuss your specific concerns and goals. They can evaluate your skin condition, recommend the most suitable treatment options, and create a personalized treatment plan to address sagging skin eﬀectively.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha](data:image/jpeg;base64,)\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.

With advanced medical support, dermatology has proven beneficial in treating a variety of skin-related concerns effectively. Stubborn skin conditions like scars, acne, pigmentation and uneven texture along with fine lines can efficiently be treated with the most advanced laser employed approach i.e laser skin resurfacing.\n\nLaser resurfacing is a procedure to diminish the occurrence of various facial skin irregularities, such as scars left behind by acne and other skin blemishes. It is a technique in which short, concentrated waves of laser light are directed at damaged or targeted skin. In this procedure, the laser precisely removes the dead skin layer by layer. It is a very popular procedure and is sometimes known as lasabrasion, laser peel, or laser vaporization.\n\nAt Citrine Clinic, we perform premium skin treatments under the guidance of skillful doctors and experienced staff. We understand the desire to look beautiful and rejuvenated and we offer patient-centric treatments. Get the best skin resurfacing treatment in Gurgaon at our clinic and bid adieu to stubborn scars.\n\n## What is Laser Skin Resurfacing?\n\nLaser skin resurfacing is performed by using concentrated beams of laser light to treat damaged sites on the body. Laser therapy works excellently in the improvement of the appearance of scars. The laser is exposed over the skin to remove damaged skin cells and diminish scars.\n\n**The most common scars are**\n\n- Injury or wound scars\n- Burn marks\n- Acne scars\n\nLaser Skin Resurfacing procedure utilizes the skin’s natural capability to reinvigorate and repair itself. Laser skin resurfacing is a form of skin laser treatment and must be performed by an experienced dermatologist or skin doctor. In other words, laser light is used to improve the overall appearance and look of the skin giving it an even and glowing texture.\n\n## How does Laser Skin Resurfacing work?\n\nThe process of laser skin resurfacing primarily works on the principle of collagen regeneration. The procedure is carried out with an aim to spur up collagen production and encourage wound healing. It is performed by causing tiny but controlled injuries or punctures in the skin using the laser. This leads to increased cell regeneration and smoother, firmer and more radiant skin. It is always better to consult an expert *Laser Skin Resurfacing Doctor in Gurgaon* and know all about the procedure and expected results.\n\nIn this procedure, the laser light targets the outermost layer of the skin simultaneously penetrating in the deeper layers of the skin and thereby heating it too. This is performed to boost collagen reproduction for faster healing. The increased collagen helps in the achievement of smoother and firmer looking skin. Patients must note that laser skin resurfacing treatment does not make a scar completely disappear. Instead, it is designed to make a scar less visible and less noticeable.\n\nThe punctures made on the targeted sites facilitate the body to initiate the process of healing a scar after an induced skin injury. When an injury mark becomes permanent, advanced laser skin treatments can be practiced to eliminate the outermost layer of the damaged skin. It basically smoothes out the damaged skin to enhance skin tone and appearance.\n\nThese lasers are safe and FDA approved making this treatment a popular and effective method. It is employed to target the blood vessels of the scarring tissue and reduce redness. Lasers are designed to puncture the skin’s surface to spur up the generation of newer and healthy skin cells.\n\nOur clinic offers the most advanced treatments for skin rejuvenation in Gurgaon.

Our procedures are safe and give impressive results.\n\n### Radiofrequency\n\nThis is a very appealing procedure because it’s a non-surgical treatment and a relatively gentle way to tighten loose skin. Most skin experts recommend radiofrequency (RF) procedure as the best way to tighten sagging skin. It is considered as the newest and the most effective technology for non-surgical skin tightening. In this procedure, RF energy heats the collagen beneath the surface of the skin, inducing its contraction and increased collagen production. Since collagen is responsible for skin's elasticity and firmness, the basic aim of this procedure is to stimulate its production. It adds firmness to the sagging skin of the neck and the face effectively. It imparts a younger-looking appearance by defeating jowls and double chin. It also gives a contoured and well-defined jawline.

Ultherapy treatment is a most preferred treatment that helps in regenerating skin to its original, firm and radiant nature without any kind of surgery. This therapy is a non-surgical approach and employs ultrasound therapy that binds facial tissues together and strengthens the tissue by extensive heating. This procedure involves ultrasound energy dispensed in the treated area. Ultherapy employs sound waves that boosts the production of collagen. It has proven results in tightening the neck, chin, and brow giving an overall firmer look. Ultrasound waves emitted during Ultherapy, can penetrate the skin at different depths, this enables the body’s regenerative response to steadily and gently lift the loose skin. There is no downtime, and the results are natural.\n\n### Micro-needling\n\nThis is one of the most preferred methods of skin tightening, and this is also known as collagen induction therapy. In the micro-needling procedure, tiny needles are involved that help in creating punctures into the targeted area that in turns, spur up the production of collagen. These super-fine needles create multiple invisible and controlled injuries on the outermost layer of the skin known as micro-injuries. These automate the body's wound-healing processes and improvement in the texture of the skin and tightness is seen. It produces newer collagen cells that help in filling up the creases making one look younger.\n\n### Laser Skin Tightening\n\nLaser skin tightening is a unique facial rejuvenation treatment option that offers a dramatic improvement in the appearance of wrinkles and baggy skin for a youthful appearance. It is a minimally invasive treatment that employs an infrared light source that helps in contracting the skin by heating the collagen fibers under the skin causing the skin to tighten. The results are instant, and no downtime is associated with it.

Thread Lift\n\n# Thread lift Treatment in Gurgaon\n\nThreadlift Treatment Cost in Gurgaon ranges from Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 1,20,000.\n\nThread lift Treatment in Gurgaon: Our skin tends to lose its firmness and natural elasticity with age. As a result, the skin tends to sag and appears baggy giving an older and tired appearance. The increased popularity of non-invasive beauty procedures has completely changed the aesthetic practice. Patients now prefer less invasive, less painful, less expensive procedures with comfortable and shorter downtime. Thread lift also known as the Non-Surgical Facelift is one such procedure when it comes to anti-aging treatments.\n\nThe patient must consult a board-certified dermatologist before opting for such procedures to understand all the necessary details. To learn about the cost of thread lift in Gurgaon, one can contact Dr. Niti Gaur, the **[best dermatologist in Gurgaon](https://www.citrineclinic.com/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)** at Citrine Clinic.\n\nThread-lift is one of the newest approaches to non-surgical facial tightening and has gained much attention since its emergence. It involves the suspension of loose skin by stitching up the portion of it. It is a less invasive Anti Aging Treatment, where absorbable sutures lift and realign the sagging tissue. These temporary sutures produce a natural and noticeable \"lift\" in the skin. Therefore, this procedure doesn't involve removal of the loose skin with any surgical method\n\nThread lift simply lifts the baggy skin and stimulates collagen production giving the skin a youthful and rejuvenated appearance. Collagen is a fiber-rich protein that is produced in the human body and is mainly found in the bones, muscles, skin, and tendons. It encourages the generation of \"growth factors\" that considerably influence the health of the skin.\n\nCollagen helps keep the skin healthy, voluminous, and flexible and helps in wound healing as well. With age the body gradually tends to produce less collagen. The decreased production of this protein leads to about 60% to 80% reduction in the thickness of the skin. This can be seen as a significant loss of volume and firmness of the skin. Lack of collagen production is a major factor in wrinkles and saggy skin tissue formation. This makes the skin grow weaker, and it loses the ability to support the underlying skin tissues adequately. The basic law of gravity works here as it pulls the skin downwards and stretches it.\n\nAt **[Citrine Clinic](https://www.citrineclinic.com/skin-clinic-in-gurgaon)**, we provide various Anti Aging Treatments that are designed for ultimate skin rejuvenation. With the *best **thread Lift treatment in Gurgaon**,* one can get the youthful skin back.\n\nHow does thread lift work?\n\nA thread lift procedure works as an excellent anti-aging treatment by reducing the signs of aging like fine lines, sagging and deep creases that appear due to aging. It works by pulling the skin back slightly and then giving it a lifted look. It not only helps in simply 'lifting' of the skin, but the threads employed in the procedure combat aging in another way also. These threads stimulate and provoke the body's natural \"healing response\" by prompting the body to deliver massive surges of collagen in the targeted sites. This is important as collagen plays a very important role in the aging process. The human body is biologically programmed to respond this way when it senses any extraneous object existing within the dermis layer of the skin. In other words, this process provides continuous and gradual rejuvenation for the facial tissues. Patients who undergo a thread lift treatment notice a visible and progressive improvement in their skin's tone and firmness. Almost instantaneously, the treated areas are slightly lifted and raised, reducing the droopiness and giving patients a reinvigorated look.\n\nThread lifts are performed under local anesthesia. The downtime associated with this procedure is minimal. It is a low-risk procedure and the recovery is not intensive since it doesn't require any incisions. The procedure is more suitable for patients who are struggling with mild to moderate signs of skin laxity. So, if you are looking for a good anti-aging treatment or a non surgical facelift treatment in Gurgaon, you can visit Citrine Clinic.\n\nThread Lift Treatment Cost in Gurgaon\n\nThreadlift Treatment Cost in Gurgaon ranges from Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 1,20,000\n\nThread Lift Treatment Cost in Gurgaon varies with the region, condition, and specialist. The patient’s profile forms a baseline for the cost calculation based on the extent, complexity, and general health to achieve the desired goal of modifying the look. The cost of one thread is an important cost determining factor. The requirement of the number of threads is further dependent on the age and type/ extent of the surgery (area of the face or body) like lower face, midface, or both requiring the lift. Additional treatment of fat transfer is optional depending on the skin type to give a more natural look by deflating the fat from the particular area. The other contributing factors for the **threadlift treatment cost in Gurgaon** include:\n\n- Duration of the surgery,\n- The experience of the dermatologist,\n- Location of the clinic,\n- Hospital/ clinic facility,\n- Medicines and consumables used during the surgery,\n- Pressure garments\n- Supporting tests, and\n- Post-operative care management along with follow-up consultations.\n\nThe insurance policy may or may not cover the treatment and its expected complications. It is best to clear your queries with your doctor before going under the needle. Feel free to contact us to learn more about the suitable treatment approach as per your requirements and the respective cost.\n\nRequest An Appointment\n\nSelect Service\\*Acne/PimpleAcne ScarsPigmentation & Skin GlowAnti-AgingStretch MarksGeneral Skin ConcernNon-SurgicalInfectionsPlastic SurgeryHair TransplantHairfall/Hair LossOthers\n\n![Captcha](data:image/jpeg;base64,)\n\n![Refresh](assets/images/reload.webp)\n\nSubmit\n\nCitrine Clinic\n\n![Location](assets/images/location.webp)\n\nSCO- 19, Huda Market Road, Sector 15 Part 2,   \nMarket Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India.\n\n**Clinic Timing:**  Monday - Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM | Sunday: Closed   \n**Phone:** [+91-9868649805](tel:+91-9868649805) | [+91-9810652808](tel:+91-9810652808)  \n**Landline:** [0124 411 6808](tel:+01244116808)  \n**Email:** [info@citrineclinic.com](mailto:info@citrineclinic.com)\n\nFor purchasing cosmetic products\n\n[Shop Now](https://lanternmeds.com/)\n\nExplore\n\n- [Carbon Peel in Gurgaon](/carbon-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Acne Scar Treatment in Gurgaon](/acne-scar-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Pigmentation Treatment in Gurgaon](/hyperpigmentation-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dark Circles Treatment in Gurgaon](/dark-circles-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Laser Tattoo Removal Treatment in Gurgaon](/laser-tattoo-removal-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Medifacial Treatment in Gurgaon](/medifacial-for-pigmentation)\n- [Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/paediatric-dermatology)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Faridabad](/best-dermatologist-in-faridabad)\n\n- [Laser Hair Removal in Gurgaon](/laser-hair-removal-in-gurgaon)\n- [Stretch Marks Treatment in Gurgaon](/stretch-marks-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Anti Wrinkle Injection in Gurgaon](/anti-wrinkle-injection-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermal Filler Treatment in Gurgaon](/dermal-fillers-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Skin Resurfacing Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-resurfacing-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Fut Hair Transplant in Gurgaon](/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon)\n- [Melasma Treatment in Gurgaon](/melasma-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Delhi](/best-dermatologist-in-delhi)\n\n- [Skin Tightening Treatment in Gurgaon](/skin-tightening-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Chemical Peel Treatment in Gurgaon](/chemical-peel-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Threadlift Treatment in Gurgaon](/thread-lift-treatment-gurgaon)\n- [Mesotherapy Treatment in Gurgaon](/mesotherapy-treatment-in-gurgaon)\n- [Dermatologist in Gurgaon](/dermatologist-in-gurgaon)\n- [Hair Transplant Gurgaon](/hair-transplant-gurgaon)\n- [Ear Piercing in Gurgaon](/ear-piercing-gurgaon)\n- [Best Dermatologist in Noida](/best-dermatologist-in-noida)\n\n![Citrine Clinic](assets/images/img/logo.webp)\n\nDr. Niti Gaur has set up Citrine Clinic and Aesthetics to provide the highest quality of skin care with the transparent and ethical practices of dermatology.
