Got it ✅ You basically want to build an **intelligent healthcare chatbot layer** on top of your APIs with strict guardrails and proper intent handling. Let me break down the exact issues and then show you how to fix them:

---

## 🔒 Guardrails (Fix #1)

* If the **user asks a specific question** (e.g., *“What is the cost of hairfall treatment in men?”*), the bot should return **only that answer** — no extra "related things".
* Add **intent classification** → only respond within healthcare context, and fallback with *“Sorry, I can only answer health-related queries or book an appointment.”*

---

## 🧑‍⚕️ Doctor API (Fix #2)

**Current issue:**
You are fetching doctors, but only showing `doctorid`.

**Solution:**
From this endpoint:

```
GET https://pmsapi.healthlantern.com/api/get_staff_List_chatboard/1a26495729bbc804007b72e98803cab4
```

→ The API response includes doctor details (name, specialization, etc).
Instead of showing `doctorid`, map it to doctor name, specialization, and availability.
Example expected output:

```
Available Doctors:
1. Dr. Amit Sharma – Dermatologist
2. Dr. Neha Gupta – Hair Specialist
3. Dr. Rajeev Sinha – General Physician
```

## 📅 Appointment Booking API (Fix #3)

**Use case:** If user says *“Book me an appointment with Dr. Amit on 5th Sept”*, detect intent → collect details → call:

```
POST https://pmsapi.healthlantern.com/api/Appointment_form_data_put
?name=Kamal
&email=kamal@gmail.com
&phone=9876543210
&date=2025-09-05
&service=Hairfall Consultation
&clinic_location_id=1
&message=Appointment booking
&app_source=chatbot
&auth_token=1a26495729bbc804007b72e98803cab4
```

✅ Return confirmation: *“Your appointment with Dr. Amit Sharma on 5th Sept has been booked. You’ll receive an email shortly.”*

## 🏥 Clinic Info API (Fix #4)

From:

```
https://pmsapi.healthlantern.com/api/organization_chatboard/1a26495729bbc804007b72e98803cab4
```

You can answer things like:

* “What is your clinic address?”
* “What services do you provide?”
* “What are your working hours?”

## 🧠 Intelligence Layer (Architecture)

### Step 1: **Detect Intent**

Possible intents:

1. **Cost Inquiry** → respond with specific cost from DB/API (no extra info).
2. **Doctor Availability** → fetch doctor list + specialization.
3. **Book Appointment** → trigger appointment API.
4. **Clinic Info** → fetch clinic API.
5. **Fallback** → reply *“I can only help with health-related queries.”*

---

### Step 2: **Guardrail Logic**

```js
if (intent === "cost_inquiry") {
   return ONLY cost (no extra info);
}
if (intent === "doctor_availability") {
   call doctor API → show names & specialization;
}
if (intent === "book_appointment") {
   collect details → call POST API → return confirmation;
}
if (intent === "clinic_info") {
   call clinic API → return info;
}
else {
   return "Sorry, I can only help with health-related queries or appointments.";
}
```

---

### Step 3: **Doctor Mapping Example**

```js
function formatDoctors(apiResponse) {
  return apiResponse.data.map(doc => ({
    id: doc.doctorid,
    name: doc.name,
    specialization: doc.specialization || "General",
    available: doc.is_available ? "Available" : "Not Available"
  }));
}
```

---

⚡ Next Step:
Do you want me to **build the full Node.js/Express middleware** that:

* Detects intent,
* Calls the correct API,
* And responds cleanly (with guardrails)?

Or should I first **write a flow diagram** of how this chatbot decision engine will work?
